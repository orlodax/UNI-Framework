# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The UNI.Framework team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/orlodax/UNI-Framework/security/advisories/new).

### What to Expect

After you have submitted a vulnerability report, you can expect the following response process:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report ASAP.
2. **Verification**: Our security team will work to verify the vulnerability and determine its impact.
3. **Remediation Planning**: We will develop a plan to address the vulnerability and communicate our plans with you.
4. **Fix Implementation**: We will implement the fix and test it thoroughly.
5. **Public Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability has been fixed, we will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline.
